## Additional Comments
I found this project to be an interesting, yet enjoyable challenge. There are some sections that I could have done better at making more clear and concise, but I think for the most part I did a good job. I especially enjoyed the first portion of the assignment, the conversion of roman numerals to decimals numbers, which only took me 30 minutes to complete. Converting the decimal numbers back to roman numerals and final quality checks required the largest portion of my time. This last part was more challenging for me but I feel my documentation of comments will make it easily interpreted.
